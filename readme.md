# Portofolion
Portofolion (temp) is a site to showcase your github works! It works by signing in to an account, then linking your github account using OAuth, and set which repo you want to showcase, and which is not. This project is made using Express as the backend, and Vue & Vuetify as the frontend. For both side I used typescript.

To install :  
    
    npm install ./client   
    npm install ./server   
    npm run start ./server   
    npm run serve ./client
