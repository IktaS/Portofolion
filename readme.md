# PortoGit (New Name)
PortoGit is a site to showcase your github works! It works by signing in to an account, then linking your github account using OAuth, and set which repo you want to showcase, and which is not.

After that, your user page will show the github repositories in which you recently pushed to! You can show the world what's you've been working on in a sleek manner.

You can check it out in [PortoGit](https://portogit.ikta.dev)
